    Battlegrounds:
        Localized turn-taking
        Players can vote on time limit for turns
        Players can vote to enable/disable turn-based play
        Battlegrounds are formed by overlapping viewports of two or more players
        Battleground boundaries are dependent upon viewport history of players in the battleground:
            Grid-points that were within a battleground stay within the battleground for some duration of time after they are no longer in the viewport of any players within a battleground.
        When two or more battlegrounds are bridged by one or more player viewports, they must merge into a single battleground:
            All players are notified of this change
            A vote is forced such that players must choose which battlegrounds rules to follow, with an additional option of choosing to vote on a new ruleset.
