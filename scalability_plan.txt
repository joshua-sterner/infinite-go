Go board is split into blocks.
Only one server instance can access a region at a time.
sync server keeps track of which server instances have a lock on a particular region
    Could probably run multiple block access servers if needed and rely on a majority rule
Blocks can be stored in multiple databases
sync server keeps track of block db synchronization
